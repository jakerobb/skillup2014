#Mimic

Recipe:
1. Simply try to mimic the states of a site, personal project, or professional project
2. Support navigation using ui-sref on buttons

You can use the state generator to help get started:
    1. Run "npm install -g generator-eggheadio"
    2. Create a "states.md" file
    3, Run "yo eggheadio:state appname"
